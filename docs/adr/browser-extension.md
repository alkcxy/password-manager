# ADR: Browser Extension for Auto-saving Passwords

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-06-02  
**Issue:** #51

---

## Context

The password manager is a self-hosted Rails 8 app (MongoDB, Hotwire) with session-based authentication. There is no existing API layer. The goal is to add a browser extension for Chrome and Vivaldi (both Chromium, both support Manifest V3) that can:

1. Capture credentials when the user logs in to a site and save them to this password manager
2. Auto-fill login forms from credentials stored in the password manager

---

## Architecture

### Extension components (Manifest V3)

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Content script** | Detect `<input type="password">`, intercept form `submit`, show a save prompt; use `MutationObserver` to handle SPAs that render fields after initial load |
| **Background service worker** | Call the Rails API, manage the auth token, handle token refresh |
| **Extension popup** | Show credentials matching the current domain, trigger fill, login/logout flow |

### Build tooling

Plain JavaScript + ES modules — no Node.js build pipeline. Consistent with the Rails app's import-map approach and avoids tooling overhead for a personal self-hosted tool. If the popup grows complex, a single `esbuild` step is acceptable.

### Distribution

Published on the Chrome Web Store ($5 one-time developer fee).

For development, load as unpacked extension:
- Vivaldi: `vivaldi://extensions`
- Chrome: `chrome://extensions`

### Stable extension ID (development + production)

The extension ID is derived deterministically from a keypair baked into `manifest.json`. This means the ID is stable across reloads and reinstalls — no need to update the CORS config each time, and no dependency on Chrome Web Store publication for a fixed ID.

Generate the keypair once:

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -out extension/key.pem
openssl rsa -in extension/key.pem -pubout -outform DER | base64 -w0
```

Add the Base64 output to `manifest.json`:

```json
"key": "<base64-encoded-public-key>"
```

The resulting ID (visible in `chrome://extensions` after loading unpacked) is set once in the Rails environment as `EXTENSION_ID` and never changes. The private key (`key.pem`) must be kept secret and excluded from version control.

**HTTP in development**: Chrome treats `localhost` as a secure context — the extension can call `http://localhost:3000` without HTTPS. No special setup needed for local testing.

### Configurable base URL

The extension must work with any self-hosted instance. The base URL of the Rails app (e.g. `https://pm.example.com`) is stored in `chrome.storage.sync` via an **Options page** and read by the background service worker on every API call. This is required for Chrome Web Store publication.

---

## Rails API additions required

The extension cannot use session cookies (cross-origin). A token-based auth layer must be added on top of the existing session auth.

A new `ApiToken` Mongoid model will store tokens: `token` (opaque, SecureRandom hex), `user_id`, `expires_at`, `created_at`.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Request body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/sessions` | POST | `{ email, password }` | `{ token, expires_at }` |
| `/api/sessions/:token` | DELETE | — | `204 No Content` |
| `/api/credentials` | GET | `?domain=<host>` | `[{ id, name, username, url }]` |
| `/api/credentials/:id` | GET | — | `{ id, name, username, url, password, note }` |
| `/api/credentials` | POST | `{ name, username, password, url, note }` | `{ id, name }` |

**`GET /api/credentials` (list) never returns the password** — only metadata. The password is exposed only via `GET /api/credentials/:id` (single credential), used by the extension popup to autofill the password field.

All responses are JSON. All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` except `POST /api/sessions`.

### Rails implementation notes

- New namespace: `app/controllers/api/`
- `Api::BaseController`: reads and validates Bearer token, sets `current_user`
- `Api::SessionsController`: create/destroy
- `Api::CredentialsController`: index (filtered by domain via `url` field), show (returns password for autofill), create
- CORS: add `rack-cors` gem, whitelist `chrome-extension://<extension-id>`
- No changes to existing web controllers

---

## Auth token lifecycle

```
Extension login
  → POST /api/sessions { email, password }
  ← { token, expires_at }
  → stored in chrome.storage.local

Per-request
  → Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ← 401 if expired or not found

Extension logout
  → DELETE /api/sessions/:token
  ← 204

Token expiry
  → 30-day TTL (configurable via env var API_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS)
  → Expired tokens are rejected; user must log in again
```

`chrome.storage.local` provides OS-level encryption on most platforms and is isolated per extension — preferable to `localStorage` which is accessible to page scripts.

---

## Security considerations

- **HTTPS assumed.** The app is deployed on a public domain under HTTPS — no self-signed cert setup needed.
- **CORS:** whitelist only `chrome-extension://<extension-id>`. The ID is stable because it is derived from the keypair in `manifest.json` — set `EXTENSION_ID` env var once, never touch it again.
- **Rate-limit** `POST /api/sessions` to prevent brute-force (e.g. `rack-attack`, 5 req/min per IP).
- **Token rotation:** not implemented in v1; acceptable for personal use.
- **No auto-submit:** the content script fills fields only — the user always clicks Submit themselves.

## Known limitations

| Limitation | Notes |
|---|---|
| No offline support | Extension needs the Rails app reachable on the network |
| No Firefox support | MV3 divergence makes cross-browser support non-trivial; out of scope |
| No password retrieval via extension | `GET /api/credentials` returns metadata only; use `GET /api/credentials/:id` to retrieve the password for autofill |
| Cross-origin iframes | Login forms embedded from a different domain (Auth0, Okta, Stripe) are inaccessible to the content script — hard browser limit |
| Shadow DOM | Form fields inside Shadow DOM components may not be reachable via standard `querySelector` |
| Non-standard SPA event handling | Some React/Vue apps require specific synthetic events to detect programmatically injected values; requires per-site testing |

## What this ADR does NOT cover

- Firefox support (MV3 divergence, out of scope)
- Extension UI design details beyond the functional requirements above
